# Clustering-Countries-With-K-Means-For-HELP-International
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

HELP International have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively.

With this dataset, we will be using K-Means Clustering to cluster the countries, to categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. And then, with PCA, we will decide which countries need help the most.
